There's a strange sound.
The name of the book is "Treasure Island". There's a word engraved in the flyleaf: "Yoho" and a message: "Long John Silver left two treasures on Treasure Island!"
Nothing happens.
There's something there alright. Maybe I should.
That's not very safe.
You may need magic here.
Everything spins around and suddenly you are elsewhere...
The torch is lit.
I was wrong. I guess it's not a mongoose because the snakes bit it.
I'm snake bit.
The parrot attacks the snakes and drives them off.
The pirate won't let me.
It's locked.
It's open.
There are a set of plans in it.
Not whilst I'm carrying it.
The crocodiles stop me.
Sorry, I can't.
Wrong game you silly goose!
I don't have it.
The pirate grabs the rum and scuttles off chortling.
...I think it's me. Hee Hee.
It's nailed to the floor.
"Magic Word" Ho and a ... (Work on it. You'll get it.)
No. Something is missing!
It was a tight squeeze!
Something won't fit.
Since nothing is happening...
I slipped and fell...
Something falls out.
They're plans to build "Jolly Roger" (a pirate ship!) You'll need hammer, nails, lumber, anchor, sails and a keel.
I've no container.
It soaks into the ground.
It's too dry. The fish vanish.
The pirate awakens and says "Aye Matey, we be casting off soon." He then vanishes.
What a waste...
I've no crew.
The pirate says "Aye Matey, we be needing a map first."
After a month at sea we set anchor off of a sandy beach. All ashore who's going ashore...
Try "Weigh Anchor".
There's a map in it.
It's a map to Treasure Island. At the bottom it says "30 paces and then dig!"
* Welcome to "Pirate Adventure" by Scott & Alexis Adams. *
It's empty.
I've no plans!
Open it?
Go there?
I found something!
I didn't find anything.
I don't see it here.
OK, I've walked off 30 paces.
Congratulations !!! But you adventure is not over yet...
Reading expands the mind.
The parrot crys...
"Check the bag Matey."
"Check the chest Matey."
From the other side!
Open the book!
There are multiple exits here!
The crocodiles eat the fish and leave.
I'm underwater. I can't swim. Blub blub...
"Pieces of Eight."
It's stuck in the sand.
Use one word.
The pirate says "Aye Matey, we be waiting for the tide to come in."
The tide is out.
The tide is coming in.
About twenty pounds. Try "Set Sail".
"Tides a changing Matey."
Note here: "I be liking parrots. They be smart Matey."
The pirate follows you ashore as if he is waiting for something.
